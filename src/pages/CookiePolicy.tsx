              A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by
              a web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be
              read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
              Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features
              or select certain preferences, and some cookies are essential to
              the Site, Software, and/or Services, and will always be used. Web
              beacons, tags, and scripts may be used in the Site or in emails to
              help us deliver cookies and count visits, understand usage and
              campaign effectiveness, and determine whether an email has been
              opened and acted upon. We may receive reports based on the use of
              these technologies by our service/analytics providers (for
              example, Google Analytics) on an individual and aggregated basis.
